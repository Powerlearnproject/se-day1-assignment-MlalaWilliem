#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software Engineering is the process of developing solutions in terms if design, building and testing software applications for end-users. It is important in terms of giving controlled access to industry resources, improving productivity and also helps to maintain and run businesses. 

It can also be used for problem solivng, quality assurance with inout and outp validations plus providing security.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1960s)- This is the time when Software Engineering was developed with what we refer to as Programming Languages. This led to the creation of early high-level programming languages, like Fortran and COBOL, which allowed for more efficient and reliable software development.
2. The Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970s)- This is a structured approach to software engineering and how to develop systems in a much more strict order. This model offered a framework that helped bring more discipline to software engineering, although it was later criticized for its lack of flexibility in responding to changes once the process had begun. Nonetheless, it laid the foundation for future software development methodologies and introduced the idea that software development
3.  The Introduction of DevOps (2009 - Present)- is a set of practices that aims to unite and also allow software development and IT operations to work efficitly and concurrently. It allows developers to build whiles being apply to test, apply quality assurence and update applications without less impact on IT oprations or user experience. It has helped develop and integrate systems quicker enabling faster innovations.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning- This is where we define the purpose and the scope of software or application. It includes things like resources required to build and what to build, the time and which strategy to use. These can be supported as project plans and risk assessments before we start the velopment process.
2. Design- This is where we define the architecture of the software and blueprint of the software, the requirements and how it need to look. this includes designing UIs and defining UX
3. Development- This is a stage where wwe start implementing the application development. We start building the code of the application which is what will support the logic and the processes defined in an application.
4. Testing- Checking and also validating the quality of the application and security. This includes things like Pentesting, were we debug and identify bugs and vulnerabilities.
5. Deployment- Give users access to the application for use, this includes installations, user training and monitoring system.
6. Maintenance- This includes the updating and the monitoring of issues in the system and adding new features to improve the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methology
-This strategy focus on completing a task/stage before going to the other taks/stage
-Well-defined path through its phases
-Once a phase is completed, it typically does not revisit that phase, making it difficult to accommodate changes.
Scenarios For Waterfall Methodology:
-Building a National Database System to store sensitive public information, such as citizen records, taxation data, and healthcare information.
designing a navigation system for commercial aircraft, where safety and accuracy are critical.
Agile Methodology
-approach where work is done in small, manageable segments called sprints
-Emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptation to changing requirements.
-encourage continuous improvement and frequent reassessment of project goals.
Scenarios for Agile Methodology:
- mobile app for tracking personal fitness and wellness. The app will include features like exercise tracking, meal logging, and community engagement. The product is expected to evolve based on user feedback and changing market demands.
- launching a new e-commerce platform for selling products online. The website must support product browsing, secure payment systems, and user accounts. Frequent updates and new features are needed, such as promotions or customer-requested changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer- Design, code and implement the functionalities of the application. It also includes testing, documenting and also applying updates.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer- Primary job is to test and ensure App, compliance and legal requirements of the application are met, plus the security of the system.
3. Project Manager- Is responsible for managinf all processes of the Application in terms of the planning, Task assignment, coordinations and monitoring all processes to ensure the succession of the application.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs are components neeeded or used for developing applcations,  typically consists of a code editor, compiler or interpreter, build automation tools, and debugger, which all work together to facilitate the software development process. They are important for increasing productivty as you can test, build and debug using a single IDE. They also work with VCS to improve intergation and deployment. 
E.g: Pycharm, VS Code, Eclipse, Android studio etc...

-VCS are used to track changes to source code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently on a project. They play a huge role in Collaration to allow multiple developers to work simlutaneoulsy on a software. Backing up and managing redundacy and Code integrity.
E.g Git, Mercurial and CVS(Concurrent Versioning systems) and BitBucket

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Skills limitation when it comes to coding and improving features. To improve we can intergrate coding with AI so to assist in building and coming up with better codes to improve the applications features.
-Old application codes and outdated languages or enviroments. To improve we can refractor code and also implementing Unit tesing.
-Debugging and Troubleshooting Complex Bugs. To overcome we can use logging and Monitoring to detect such and also track system changes. also use automated testing and normally Isolate problems to minimize their complexity
-Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes. This needs Continuos learning to further improve developers skills and the use of methodologies that encourage collaboration.




Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit Testing- Tesign all componets and tools used for developting and also those used by our software. Helps to detect bug early, which systems to improve and change.
-Integration testing- Testing all integrating systems in your applications, also components that need to function and work together. Helps identity Integration and data sharing issues and also nsure that the interfaces between different modules, services, or subsystems are correctly defined and work as intended.
-System testing- Testing the full system from development to oprations. Checks software against the overall system requirements and ensures it performs as expected in the intended environment. helps ensure all features, functions, and components work together to meet the specifications and requirements of the software. Plus it improves the perfomance of the application.
-Aceeptance testing- This focuses on the business requirements whether they are met or not, also this is refers to chain of custody and how the application meet the business requirements. Helps with User validation, meeting business needs and also ensures that the system meets the functional, non-functional, and business requirements as agreed upon with stakeholders.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Refers to the process of designing and using the input prompts used to interact with AI models (like language models) to achieve the desired output. The goal of prompt engineering is to accept queries, instructions, or input text in the most accurate, relevant, or useful responses from the AI system.
It can generate a wide variety of responses depending on how the input is framed to produce more precise, relevant, and useful answers. useful when interacting with AI models in specific domains or industries, such as healthcare, law, or technology. By designing prompts with domain-specific language or constraints, users can get responses that are more relevant to their area of interest.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about smartphones."
Improved Prompt:
"Compare the battery life, camera quality, and processing speed of the latest iPhone and Samsung Galaxy models."
This offers clarity and specifically give the information relevant to what you may want in the details of the answer.
Focused output Leading to a response that’s detailed and directly aligned with the user’s request 
his refined prompt asks for a comparison, which means the AI should deliver a direct side-by-side evaluation, making it easier for the user to assess the differences between the two brands on those specific metrics.
"Tell me about smartphones."
